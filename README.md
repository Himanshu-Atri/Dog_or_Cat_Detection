# Dog_or_Cat_Detection
A cat or dog detection model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images as either a cat or a dog. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of cat and dog images, allowing it to learn and identify distinguishing features. Once trained, the model can accurately predict whether a new image contains a cat or a dog.
